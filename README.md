# 🛒 Sales Data Analysis

This project consists of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset containing information about products, customers, transaction dates, and sales figures. It was developed as part of my data analytics learning path, combining skills in Python, pandas, data cleaning, visualization, and exporting meaningful insights.

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw sales data
- Identify the best-selling products
- Determine customer spending patterns
- Detect outliers and missing values
- Visualize sales distributions
- Export processed tables for further analysis or reporting

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `product`: name of the item sold
- `units_sold`: number of units sold
- `unit_price`: price per unit
- `date`: date of the sale
- `customer`: customer name
- `total_sale`: calculated as `units_sold * unit_price`

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included

- `clean_data.csv`: cleaned sales data
- `units_per_product`: total units sold per product
- `total_expense_clients.csv`: total spending per customer
- `sales_data.ipynb`: full analysis process (cleaning, EDA, charts)
- `README.md`: this description

## 📌 Key Insights

- Laptops were the best-selling product in the dataset.
- A small group of customers generated the majority of the revenue.
- No major outliers were found in sales amounts.
- The dataset was successfully cleaned and is ready for reporting or dashboarding.
